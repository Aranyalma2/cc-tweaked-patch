# Polymer Patch for CC: Tweaked
Doing things no one else did...

## What is this?
This is a patch for [CC: Tweaked](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-tweaked) (which by itself is fork/continuation of original ComputerCraft), that modifies it allowing nearly
all functionality of regular version to work purely server side (Vanilla client can join
servers using it and have all functionality!). It still requires server to run on Fabric
or Quilt, so keep that in mind!

CC: Tweaked is required and not included within this mod.

[You can read more about CC: Tweaked on it's Modrinth page!](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-tweaked)
